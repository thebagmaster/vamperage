Biggy Vamp Project

ESSENTIALS:

1) Online DB - Preferably SQL backend, probably PHP front end, but that's negotiable
2) Data validation, but still allow for custom entries - Basically, a system to enforce a relatively universal way of referencing the same items. Without something like this, data mining/reporting is going to be all but worthless. This would include an easy way for people to input new items, probably with two scopes - global and local. We can dig into it more later.
3) Robust reporting - Both on a global and a local scope.
4) Permissions - Some basic scope of permissions is going to be needed for different roles. Who can edit, who can do reporting. Preferably down to individual sheet items - for example, allow coords to report on basic sheet info (Clan/Tribe/Tradition/etc, R&U items, total XP, Generation/Rank/whatever, without being able to see the full sheet)
5) Nice looking output to RTF or PDF
6) Expenditure tracking

OPTIONAL:
1) Design it with a more modular framework so it doesn't work JUST for classic MET. Tweak some of the XP cost calculations and how attributes are handled, and suddenly it would work for Tabletop or BNS MET or anything in the future.
2) Design it as a multi-site installation with communication/API between them. Deliver it in a package almost like wordpress/phpBB or something similar. That way each game owns their own data, but org-level reporting is still possible.
3) "Click-approval" XP spends. Players submit their XP requests, STs can click yes/no/edit on each item to quickly approve them and add them to the sheet, deny the expenditure, or change the amount of XP required.
4) Rumors / Actions / Location / Influence tracking
5) More robust status / renown / etc tracking (believe me, the renown would be a HUGE godsend for Garou games)

Future:
    print equipment to 3x5

Characters have home games (approved by storytellers)
games have multiple / changing storyteller
only storytellers can add npcs to game
storytellers can succed npcs to players
storytellers can modify xp enmasse
